Plan for Deathwish:
-Set up all the stats for each of the classes:
    *Mage, Thief, Warrior, Archer, Cleric
-Level up stat changes
    * prevstat + k(1 + ((level-1)*0.01))
    * prevstat + k + (level)
-Convert to Processing

Ideas:
-Save method (write to a file?)
-Start with a basechar, choose class at level 15, 30
-Specializations of classes
